// I can not get this one to work. I am not sure if I am using the wrong methods.
// I want to print every word that contains the letters "ing", and thought this
// was the method that fit best to do that, but when I run it, I get nothing.
// I have also tried using .length and nothing returns still.

// I wanted to leave this in for potential feedback on what I could do to have
// this work.

// I ended up going over this with my eval partner and we ended up figuring it out.
